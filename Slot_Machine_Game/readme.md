This repository contains a simple command-line slot machine game implemented in JavaScript. The game simulates a slot machine with the following steps:


1. Deposit Some Money: The game starts by asking the user to input a deposit amount. This deposit will be used to place bets during the game.

2, Determine Number of Lines to Bet On: The user is prompted to enter the number of lines they want to bet on (1-3 lines).

3. Collect a Bet Amount: The user is prompted to enter a bet amount per line they are betting on. The total bet amount is subtracted from the user's balance.

4. Spin the Slot Machine: The slot machine spins, generating a random combination of symbols on the reels.

5. Check If User Won: The program checks if the user has won on any of the lines by identifying rows with identical symbols.
